    <!-- The HTML <section> element represents a standalone section â€” which doesn't have a more 
    specific semantic element to represent it â€” contained within an HTML document. Typically, 
    but not always, sections have a heading.
    As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a <nav> element, but a list of 
    search results and a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and 
    could be put inside a <section>. -->
    
    <!-- This falls all in the category of semantic HTML, 
    other examples for elements are aside, footer, form, figcaption -->

    <section>
        <h1 style="color:tomato">This is the main heading</h1>
        <p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
    </section>
    <h2>This is a secondary heading</h2>
    <h6>This is a very small heading</h6>
    <div>
      Divs are unstyled elements. They are usually used as containers for other
      elements. Div is a block element. It uses the whole width of the browser.
      <span class="text-container"
        >A span is an unstyled element. They are used as container for
        text. Span is an inline element. It uses only as much space as needed</span
      >
      <span>This is another span.</span>
      <p class="text-container another-class">
        This is a paragraph. It is a block element. Block level elements start a new line and take up the whole width.
        Inline elements flow like text.
      </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      Lists are also block elements. In an unordered list, the order of the
      elements is not relevant. Ex: shopping list
      <li>
        Pasta
      </li>
      <li id="mate-item">
        Mate
      </li>
      <li>
        Detergent
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      This is an ordered list, where the order of the elements matter.
      <li>Load the washing machine</li>
      <li>Add detergent</li>
      <li>Start the washer</li>
    </ol>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>

      </thead>
      <tbody>

    <form>
      Forms are also block elements but its children are inline elements.
      <label for="message">Leave a message</label>
      <input id="message" type="text" />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
